First personal project with TOP. I'm all excited.
This should demonstrate what I have learned so far regarding HTML (CSS will follow later).
I don't know if anyone will read this, but if you do, don't hesitate to send me a message for any reason, whether you found a typo, you want to give a piece of advice, you're following the path as me and would like a learning partner.
