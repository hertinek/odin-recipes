        <p>Home-made pasta is not so difficult.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400 g white flour</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>almond milk (yes)</li>
            <li>salt (in the water)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a mount with the flour on a table and create a hole in the middle</li>
            <li>Break the eggs inside this hole, beat them gently with a fork and slowly add flour from the rig of the mount</li>
            <li>Finish combining with hands, adding some almond milk until you obtain a homogeneous, elastic dough that doesn't stick</li>
            <li>Wrap in a clean cloth and let rest for half-an-hour in the fridge</li>
            <li>Take off pieces from the dough and shape it the way you like with a pasta machine</li>
            <li>When it's all done, pour the pasta in two liters of boiling water and taste from time to time until it's good, and serve</li>
